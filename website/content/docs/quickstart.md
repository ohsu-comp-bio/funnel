# TODO or maybe Getting Started

Here's a simple `funnel.config.yml` file for getting started:
```yaml
# Describes the storage that Funnel has access to.
Storage:
  Local:
    # You need to explicitly give Funnel access to local directories.
    AllowedDirs:
      - /home/buchanae/funnel-files
      - /tmp
```
