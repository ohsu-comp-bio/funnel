# Workflow for running the TES compliance suite against Funnel

# This includes the following steps:
#  1. Build Funnel and store the resulting binary artifact
#  2. Install tes-compliance-suite and run against every version of TES simultaneously
#  3. start-report-deployment: Send a dispatch to the funnel-compliance repository to generate and publish
#     the tes-compliance-suite report to https://ohsu-comp-bio.github.io/funnel-compliance/

# Optionally debug via SSH
# Ref: https://fleetdm.com/engineering/tips-for-github-actions-usability
#
# To use this step uncomment and place anywhere in the build steps. The build will pause on this step and
# output a ssh address associated with the Github action worker. Helpful for debugging build steps and
# and intermediary files/artifacts.
