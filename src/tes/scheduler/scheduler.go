// Scheduler is responsible for scheduling a job. It has a single method which
// is responsible for taking a job and returning an Offer which describes whether
// a scheduler can run the job, how many resources it can offer, and anything that
// might allow a central scheduler to decide where best to run the job.
//
// For example, a system might have a separate scheduler for each of
// Google Cloud, AWS, and on-premise HTCondor clusters. For a given job,
// the Google Cloud and AWS schedulers might determine that the job cannot be run
// (maybe due to data locality restrictions) and they return rejected Offers, while
// the HTCondor returns an accepted Offer. A central scheduler can then determine
// that the job should be assigned to the HTCondor cluster.
