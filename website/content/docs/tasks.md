# Tasks

A task defines a unit of work:

- metadata
- input files to download
- a sequence of Docker containers + commands to run,
- output files to upload
- state
- logs

The example task below downloads a file named `hello.txt` from S3 and calls `cat hello.txt` using the [alpine][alpine] container. This task also writes the executor's stdout to a file, and uploads the stdout to s3.

```
{
  "name": "Hello world",
  "inputs": [{
    # URL to download file from.
    "url": "s3://funnel-bucket/hello.txt",
    # Path to download file to.
    "path": "/inputs/hello.txt"
  }],
  "outputs": [{
    # URL to upload file to.
    "url": "s3://funnel-bucket/output.txt",
    # Local path to upload file from.
    "path": "/outputs/stdout"
  }],
  "executors": [{
      # Container image name.
      "image": "alpine",
      # Command to run (argv).
      "command": ["cat", "/inputs/hello.txt"],
      # Capture the stdout of the command to /outputs/stdout
      "stdout": "/outputs/stdout"
  }]
}
```

Tasks have multiple "executors"; containers and commands run in a sequence. 
Funnel runs executors via Docker.

Tasks also have state and logs:
```JSON
{
  "id": "b85khc2rl6qkqbhg8vig",
  "state": "COMPLETE",
  "name": "Hello world",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "url": "s3://funnel-bucket/hello.txt",
      "path": "/inputs/hello.txt"
    }
  ],
  "outputs": [
    {
      "url": "s3://funnel-bucket/output.txt",
      "path": "/outputs/stdout"
    }
  ],
  "executors": [
    {
      "image": "alpine",
      "command": [
        "cat",
        "/inputs/hello.txt"
      ],
      "stdout": "/outputs/stdout"
    }
  ],
  "logs": [
    {
      "logs": [
        {
          "startTime": "2017-11-14T11:49:05.127885125-08:00",
          "endTime": "2017-11-14T11:49:08.484461502-08:00",
          "stdout": "Hello, Funnel!\n"
        }
      ],
      "startTime": "2017-11-14T11:49:04.433593468-08:00",
      "endTime": "2017-11-14T11:49:08.487707039-08:00"
    }
  ],
  "creationTime": "2017-11-14T11:49:04.427163701-08:00"
}
```

There are logs for each task attempt and each executor. Notice that the stdout is
conveniently captured by `logs[0].logs[0].stdout`.

### Task API

The API lets you create, get, list, and cancel tasks.

### Create
```
POST /v1/tasks
{
  "name": "Hello world",
  "inputs": [{
    "url": "s3://funnel-bucket/hello.txt",
    "path": "/inputs/hello.txt"
  }],
  "outputs": [{
    "url": "s3://funnel-bucket/output.txt",
    "path": "/outputs/stdout"
  }],
  "executors": [{
      "image": "alpine",
      "command": ["cat", "/inputs/hello.txt"],
      "stdout": "/outputs/stdout"
  }]
}


# The response is a task ID:
b85khc2rl6qkqbhg8vig
```

### Get
```
GET /v1/tasks/b85khc2rl6qkqbhg8vig

{"id": "b85khc2rl6qkqbhg8vig", "state": "COMPLETE"}
```

By default, the minimal task view is returned which describes only the ID and state.
In order to get the original task with some basic logs, use the "BASIC" task view:
```
GET /v1/tasks/b85khc2rl6qkqbhg8vig?view=BASIC
{
  "id": "b85khc2rl6qkqbhg8vig",
  "state": "COMPLETE",
  "name": "Hello world",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "url": "gs://funnel-bucket/hello.txt",
      "path": "/inputs/hello.txt"
    }
  ],
  "outputs": [
    {
      "url": "s3://funnel-bucket/output.txt",
      "path": "/outputs/stdout"
    }
  ],
  "executors": [
    {
      "image": "alpine",
      "command": [
        "cat",
        "/inputs/hello.txt"
      ],
      "stdout": "/outputs/stdout",
    }
  ],
  "logs": [
    {
      "logs": [
        {
          "startTime": "2017-11-14T11:49:05.127885125-08:00",
          "endTime": "2017-11-14T11:49:08.484461502-08:00",
        }
      ],
      "startTime": "2017-11-14T11:49:04.433593468-08:00",
      "endTime": "2017-11-14T11:49:08.487707039-08:00"
    }
  ],
  "creationTime": "2017-11-14T11:49:04.427163701-08:00"
}
```

The "BASIC" doesn't include some fields such as stdout/err logs, because these fields may be potentially large.
In order to get everything, use the "FULL" view:
```
GET /v1/tasks/b85khc2rl6qkqbhg8vig?view=FULL
{
  "id": "b85khc2rl6qkqbhg8vig",
  "state": "COMPLETE",
  "name": "Hello world",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "url": "gs://funnel-bucket/hello.txt",
      "path": "/inputs/hello.txt"
    }
  ],
  "executors": [
    {
      "image": "alpine",
      "command": [
        "cat",
        "/inputs/hello.txt"
      ],
      "stdout": "/outputs/stdout",
    }
  ],
  "logs": [
    {
      "logs": [
        {
          "startTime": "2017-11-14T11:49:05.127885125-08:00",
          "endTime": "2017-11-14T11:49:08.484461502-08:00",
          "stdout": "Hello, Funnel!\n"
        }
      ],
      "startTime": "2017-11-14T11:49:04.433593468-08:00",
      "endTime": "2017-11-14T11:49:08.487707039-08:00"
    }
  ],
  "creationTime": "2017-11-14T11:49:04.427163701-08:00"
}
```

### List
```
GET /v1/tasks
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "b85l8tirl6qkqbhg8vj0",
      "state": "COMPLETE"
    },
    {
      "id": "b85khc2rl6qkqbhg8vig",
      "state": "COMPLETE"
    },
    {
      "id": "b85kgt2rl6qkpuptua70",
      "state": "SYSTEM_ERROR"
    },
    {
      "id": "b857gnirl6qjfou61fh0",
      "state": "SYSTEM_ERROR"
    }
  ]
}
```

List has the same task views as Get: MINIMAL, BASIC, and FULL.

The task list is paginated:
```
GET /v1/tasks?page_token=1h123h12j2h3k
{
  "next_page_token": "1n3n1j23k12n3k123",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "b85l8tirl6qkqbhg8vj0",
      "state": "COMPLETE"
    },
    # ... more tasks here ...
  ]
}
```

### Cancel 

Tasks cannot be modified by the user after creation, with one exception – they can be canceled.
```
POST /v1/tasks/b85l8tirl6qkqbhg8vj0:cancel
```


### Full task spec
