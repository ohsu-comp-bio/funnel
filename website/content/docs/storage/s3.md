# S3

## Amazon S3

Funnel supports using [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for file storage.

The S3 storage client is enabled by default, and will try to automatically
load credentials from the environment. Alternatively, you
may explicitly set the credentials in the worker config:

```
Worker:
  Storage:
    AmazonS3:
      Disabled: false
      # The maximum number of times that a request will be retried for failures.
      MaxRetries: 10
      Key: ""
      Secret: ""
```

## Other S3 API Providers

Funnel also supports using non-Amazon S3 API providers ([Ceph][ceph], 
[Cleversafe][cleversafe], [Minio][minio], etc.) for file storage.

These other S3 storage clients are NOT enabled by default. 
You must configure them. 

This storage client currently only supports the
[version 2 signing process](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-2.html).

```
Worker:
  Storage:
    GenericS3:
      - Disabled: false
        Endpoint: ""
        Key: ""
        Secret: ""
```

### Example task
