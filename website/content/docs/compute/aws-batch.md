# AWS Batch

This guide covers deploying a Funnel server that leverages [DynamoDB][0] for storage
and [AWS Batch][1] for task execution. 

## Setup

Get started by creating a compute environment, job queue and job definition using either 
the Funnel CLI or the AWS Batch web console. To manage the permissions of instanced 
AWS Batch jobs create a new IAM role. For the Funnel configuration outlined 
in this document, this role will need to provide read and write access to both S3 and DynamoDB.

_Note_: We recommend creating the Job Definition with Funnel by running: `funnel aws batch create-job-definition`. 
Funnel expects the JobDefinition to start a Funnel worker process with a specific configuration. 
Only advanced users should consider making any substantial changes to this Job Definition. 

AWS Batch tasks, by default, launch the ECS Optimized AMI which includes 
an 8GB volume for the operating system and a 22GB volume for Docker image and metadata 
storage. The default Docker configuration allocates up to 10GB of this storage to 
each container instance. [Read more about the default AMI][8]. Due to these limitations, we
recommend [creating a custom AMI][7]. Because AWS Batch has the same requirements for your 
AMI as Amazon ECS, use the default Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux AMI as a base and change it 
to better suite your tasks.

### Steps
* [Create a Compute Environment][3]
*  (_Optional_) [Create a custom AMI][7]
* [Create a Job Queue][4]
* [Create an EC2ContainerTaskRole with policies for managing access to S3 and DynamoDB][5]
* [Create a Job Definition][6]

For more information check out AWS Batch's [getting started guide][2]. 

### Quickstart

```
$ funnel aws batch create-all-resources --region us-west-2

```

This command will create a compute environment, job queue, IAM role and job definition.

## Configuring the Funnel Server

Below is an example configuration. Note that the `Key`
and `Secret` fields are left blank in the configuration of the components. This is because 
Funnel will, by default, try to will try to automatically load credentials from the environment. 
Alternatively, you may explicitly set the credentials in the config.

```YAML
Database: "dynamodb"
Compute: "aws-batch"
EventWriters:
  - "log"

Dynamodb:
  TableBasename: "funnel"
  Region: "us-west-2"
  Key: ""
  Secret: ""

Batch:
  JobDefinition: "funnel-job-def"
  JobQueue: "funnel-job-queue" 
  Region: "us-west-2"
  Key: ""
  Secret: ""
          
AmazonS3:
  Key: ""
  Secret: ""
```

### Start the server

```
funnel server run --config /path/to/config.yaml
```

### Known issues

The `Task.Resources.DiskGb` field does not have any effect. See [issue 317](https://github.com/ohsu-comp-bio/funnel/issues/317).
