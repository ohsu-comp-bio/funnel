# This workflow will install Python dependencies, run tests and lint with a single version of Python
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-python

# Optionally debug via SSH
# Ref: https://fleetdm.com/engineering/tips-for-github-actions-usability
#
# To use this step uncomment and place anywhere in the build steps. The build will pause on this step and
# output a ssh address associated with the Github action worker. Helpful for debugging build steps and
# and intermediary files/artifacts.
# Example:
#   Web shell: https://tmate.io/t/q8FU3U9SvmMVxAhMHRyExNhr8
#   SSH: ssh q8FU3U9SvmMVxAhMHRyExNhr8@sfo2.tmate.io
