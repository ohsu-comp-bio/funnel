# Embedded

By default, Funnel uses an embedded database named [BoltDB][bolt] to store task and scheduler data. This is great for development and a simple server without external dependencies, but it doesn't scale well to larger clusters.

Available config:
```
Server:
  Database: boltdb
  Databases:
    BoltDB:
      # Path to database file
      Path: ./funnel-work-dir/funnel.db
```
